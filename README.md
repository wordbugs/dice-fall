# dice fall

this is an adaptation of Mark Ball's tabletop game [Collapsi](https://riffleshuffleandroll.itch.io/collapsi/). [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vYEHdjlw3g) is a video explaining it.

the focus is on making it highly configurable, but i've put some work on it looking great.

code quality has been systematically neglected, but i might fix that at some point. and forget to remove this paragraph, because documentation has been systematically neglected too.
